# Conference Context: full_workbench_commercialization_20260707

Created: 2026-07-07 22:46:46
Objective: 将AI全流程医学经理工作台从当前3/6/8优先demo推进到所有医学相关环节的可商业化产品：建立外部/内部调研证据、9环节模块缺口矩阵、独立AI Gateway闭环、统一接口合同、下一批可执行实施切片，并记录风险/ROI/治理/前后端设计要求。
Task type: `complex_delivery_conference`
Risk: `critical`
Conference mode: `parallel`

## Codex Main Venue

- Chair: Codex.
- Duties: understand the real task, decompose, define sources of truth, route work, protect boundaries, verify final artifacts, own visual/browser/PPT/PDF checks, own production writes, and deliver to the user.

## Hermes Sub-Venue

- Lead/chair: OpenCode Go `minimax-m3`.
- Participant models: OpenCode Go `qwen3.7-plus`, OpenCode Go `mimo-v2.5`, and DeepSeek supplier `deepseek-v4-flash`, all default reasoning effort unless Codex overrides.
- All `deepseek-v4-flash` routes must use the DeepSeek supplier. OpenCode Go `deepseek-v4-flash` is not allowed for this workflow.
- `qwen3.7-plus` must be smoke-tested in this route because it recently had intermittent run errors.
- Main-venue high-risk reviewer: DeepSeek supplier `deepseek-v4-pro` only. OpenCode Go `deepseek-v4-pro` is not allowed for this role.

## Source Of Truth

- TODO: Add authoritative local files, extracts, datasets, screenshots, URLs, or user-provided materials.
- Do not add production paths unless the user explicitly authorized reading them for this task.

## Scope

- In scope: TODO
- Out of scope: TODO

## Success Criteria

- TODO

## Parallel Work Rule

For logic-heavy, rigor-sensitive, or artifact-heavy tasks, each participant independently runs the whole bounded workflow and writes a separate output. Leads compare after all available participant outputs are in or explicitly marked pending.

## Timeout Policy

- Participant soft wait: 20 minutes.
- Large-task participant wait: 45 minutes.
- Lead/main hard wait: 90 minutes.
- Failure rule: Do not fail a model for slow response alone; fail only on terminal error, provider exhaustion/rate limit after controlled retry, empty/truncated retry output, or no progress after hard wait plus one retry.

## Risk Boundaries

- Hermes is advisory; Codex remains final authority.
- Codex owns visual/browser/PPT/PDF/rendered checks, live authority checks, final clinical/regulatory conclusions, and production writes.
- Do not mark a slow model failed solely due to latency.

## Loop Log

- 2026-07-07 22:46:46: Conference initialized by `hermes_workflow_guard.py init-conference`.
