## 2026-09-01 — Phase A recovery and Trellis bootstrap

- Authority: engineering review, System Design v1.2 amendment, and implementation plan v2.0.
- Baseline commit `ea84833` includes the interrupted `g6_runtime.py`; annotated tag `mm-baseline-20260901` preserves the evidence state.
- Repair commit `0d580ae` removes the six orphan lines and normalizes the `_load_store` classmethod receiver.
- Verification: four G6 candidate files pass `py_compile`; the two focused G6 files collect and run with 17 passes plus the two expected `entry_url_mismatch` failures. Release digests and `entry_manifest.json` remain intentionally unchanged because Phase B removes the parallel application.
- Trellis initialized for Codex, Cursor, OMP, Grok, Kimi, and CodeBuddy. Phase B–F tasks and eight Phase B children created; medical-monitoring engineering and semantic constraints live in `.trellis/spec/medical-monitoring-engineering.md`.
- Next safe action: start B1 migration inventory, trace the live R7 product import graph, and write the dependency-safe migration order here before moving code.

## 2026-09-01 — B1 migration inventory

- Static traversal from the live R7/R5 product surfaces reaches 95 POC modules: R1 9, R2 5, R3 3, R4 39, R5 12, R6 5, R7 22.
- Product coupling confirmed: the 7,684-line R7 router inserts R2–R7 source roots dynamically; R5/R7 frontend generations import each other; G6 is a separate synthetic-only stack.
- Detailed module disposition and test ownership are in `.trellis/tasks/09-01-mm-b1-inventory/research/migration-inventory.md`.
- Chosen order: domain → graph/runtime primitives → intelligence → risks/projections → reports/harness → R7 runtime/API → product routes/frontend → synthetic/deletion/test cleanup.
- Next slice: move-only R1 domain/schema-shape plus the five R2 domain modules into the new package with package-native imports and focused compatibility tests.

## 2026-09-01 — B2 domain foundation

- Moved the R1 execution-domain/schema-shape authorities and complete R2 schema/entity/identity/acceptance/risk set into `packages.medical_monitoring.domain`.
- Old `mm_r1` and `mm_r2` paths are temporary compatibility shims only; package-native modules now own the implementation. No product router, frontend, model binding, fixture, or medical-writing surface changed.
- Preserved historical import behavior for R2 symbols that were public in practice but omitted from `__all__` (`ImmutableDict`, `make_record_identity`, `make_risk_identity`).
- Verification: new authorities and shims pass `py_compile`; package compatibility plus original R1/R2 focused suites pass `297 passed`.
- Next slice: migrate the R1 graph/store/controller foundation, preserving SQLite and graph behavior through compatibility shims before any runtime redesign.

## 2026-09-01 — B2 graph and store foundation

- Moved the framework-neutral graph engine and SQLite authoritative store into `packages.medical_monitoring.graph`; old imports remain temporary shims.
- Added temporary relative `packages` links inside the R1/R2 POC source roots so isolated legacy subprocesses resolve the consolidated authority without modifying `sys.path`.
- Compatibility review exposed one historical cross-module import (`RiskIdentity` from `mm_r2.risk`) that was public in practice but omitted from `__all__`; the shim now preserves it.
- Verification: consolidated graph/store and shims pass `py_compile`; package compatibility plus the complete R1 suite pass `329 passed`.
- `controller.py` remains in place until the capability runtime moves next, preventing the new package from depending backward on a POC runtime module.
